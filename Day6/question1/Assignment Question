Day 6 Assignment JA111

Q1)Write the logic to reverse the String given in the parameter without
the help of predefined reverse method and return the reversed
String:(HINT use Array)

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main{
public static String reversString(String input){
//write the logic
}
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter a String to reverse");
String orignalString = sc.next();
String result = reversString(originalString);
System.out.println("Original String is :"+ originalString);
System.out.println("Reversed String is :"+ result);
}
}


Q2) Even Sum in Columns

Description

● You have to create a 2D array, whose dimensions are N = 3,M = 3,
● The value stored in N denotes the number of rows, and the value in M denotes the number of columns
● The 2D array is stored in a variable with the name arr
● the array looks like arr = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]
● For all columns, you have to print the sum of even elements present in the column
4 (Even numbers in the column are, [4]. Therefore, the sum becomes 4)
10 (Even numbers in the row are, [2,8]. Therefore, the sum becomes 10)
6 (Even numbers in the row are, [6]. Therefore, the sum becomes 6)
Output
● For each column, print the sum of even numbers present in the column, line by line
Sample Input 1

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Sample Output 1
4
10
6

Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored inN = 3,M = 3, and the array is arr = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9], then the required output will be
4 (Even numbers in the column are, [4]. Therefore, the sum becomes 4)
10 (Even numbers in the row are, [2,8]. Therefore, the sum becomes 10)
6 (Even numbers in the row are, [6]. Therefore, the sum becomes 6)


Q3) Finding prime number inside an array:

public class Main{
public int[] findAndReturnPrimeNumbers(int[] inputArray){
//write the logic to iterate through the supplied inputArray and
//determine each element whether it is prime or not
//create a second array of int
//if any number is prime inside the inputArray then add that number inside the second
//array
//and return the second array
//if no prime number is found then return the empty array.
}

public static void main(String[] args){
//Create the object of Main class
//on the object of Main class call the findAndReturnPrimeNumbers method
//by supplying the following array as the parameter
int[] arr = {10,12,5,50,11,14,15};
//print each element from the returned array of findAndReturnPrimeNumbers method
//if findAndReturnPrimeNumbers method returns an empty array then print the following
message:
// "Prime number not found in the supplied Array"
}
}


Q4)Take the Command Line Argument and print the factorial of that number.

Case1-
If only one number is supplied then simply find the factorial of that number
Ex- input5
Output120

Case2-
If two numbers are supplied then find the absolute difference of the two numbers and then find
the factorial of the resulting number.

input5 7
Output2! (absolute difference of 5 & 7 is 2)
Case 3-
If three or more numbers are suppliedInput5 6 8 9
OutputError
