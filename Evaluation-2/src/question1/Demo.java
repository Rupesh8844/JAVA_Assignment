/*
Q1) Explain the difference between IS-A and Has-A relationship with the help of an
example and explain about access modifiers and their accessibility?

IS-A relationship means classes which is extended from the parent class they are is known as IS-A relationship.
       Has-A relatonship means classes which has child classes inside parent class is known as Has-A relationship.


Access modifiers are the modifier which is used to increase visibility as well as accessibility.Its accessibility are:
1) Public ===> which has very high visibility which can access everywhere.
2)Private ===> which is accessible inside that particular class only not outside of that particular class.
3)Protected ==> same as Default but can be access in another package with the help of inheritance.
4)Default ===> public inside the same package but act as private outside the package.
